Help with Research on Python Security Vulnerabilities 🔐

I’m Reem Almutairi, a Ph.D. student at King Saud University. I’m conducting research on security vulnerabilities in Python, and I need your expertise!

If you work with Python and have knowledge in security, please take this 10-minute survey 👉 [https://forms.gle/5BXXdC7RUnAfT9KQ6 ]

Your participation will greatly contribute to enhancing the security of Python applications. Feel free to share this with colleagues who can also contribute!

Thank you for your support! 🙌
